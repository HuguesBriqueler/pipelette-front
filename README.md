Project Pipelette

Presentation :
Project Pipelette is a project created during the "Web Developer" Wild Code School formation. It is based on an already created website : https://pipelette.co/ .


Concept:
The concept of this website is to be able to record, upload and share audio file with loved-ones and family members through something called "capsules".


How to install :

Git clone this repository, as well as the https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/reims-js-2103-project3-pipelette-back/ repository.

run npm i on both repositories,
run npm start on both repositories and voila.


How to use :

After running npm start on both repositories, a website should be hosted on the port of your choice (3000 or 8000 by default) and the sql database will be created and hosted on port 3306 by default.

You can then travel through the website and try the experience.


Technologies used : 

This project uses React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Git, GitHub, ESLint, Prettier, Nodemon, Dotenv.
